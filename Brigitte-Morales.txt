    1. What is Semantic HTML? Semantic HTML are tags that give meaning to your code. They help to describe your code and split it into sections with meaning.
    2. What is HTML used for? HTML is a markup language designed to display data in a graphical form on a webpage.
    3. What is an attribute and where do we put it? Attributes are used when you want to include information (like the link to an image) that you do not want rendered on the page. We place attributes inside of tags. 
    4. What is the h1 tag used for? How many times should I use it on a page? The h1 tag is a header tag used for the most important heading. It tells you the purpose of the overall page. It should only be used once per page.
    5. Name two tags that have required attributes: The a (anchor) tag and the image (img) tag require attributes.
    6. What do we put in the head of our HTML document?  In the head tag of an html document you would put the link tag, which whould include the rel and href attributes. The rel and href attributes would indicate that the browser is reading CSS. 
        Inside the rel attribute we would include the type of file we are linking (ex: "stylesheet") and inside the href attribute we would point to the location of the file on the computer.
    7. What is an id? Ids are titles that can only appear on a single element. It is basically a unique identifier for an element.
    8. What elements can I add an id to? You can add the id attribute to many different elements (although each uniuqe id can only be applied to a single element), such as: h1-6, div, span etc. You cannot apply it to the following elements: base, head, html, meta, script, style, title.
    9. How many times can I use the same id on a page? You can only use each id once per page.
    10. What is a class? A class is a title that can be applied to multiple elements on a page. Multiple elements can share the same class.
    11. What elements can I add a class to? The class attribute can be used on any html element.
    12. How many times can I use the same class on a page? You can use the class element multiple times on a page.
    13. How do I get my link to open in a new tab? If I use the <a href=" "> the link will open in the current window/tab (by default). To open in a new tab, I should include the target attribute and set it equal to _blank. For example, <a href=" " target=_blank>
    14. What is the alt attribute in the image tag used for? The alt attribute specifies an alternate text for an image if an image cannot be displayed.
    15. How do I reference an id? To reference an id in CSS use #.
    16. What is the difference between a section and a div: The div is a generic container used for grouping other HTML elemnets together. It is not semantic HTML. Rather, it is considered presentational HTML. It is invisible by default and is not super useful in html, but is useful for CSS. 
        In contrast, the section tag is considered semantic HTML. It can be used to wrap the content.
    17. What is CSS used for? CSS is used to add style and layout to our webpages.
    18. How to we select an element? Example - every h2 on the page: To select an element type in the element and then type {}. For example, to select all of the h2 on a page type the following: h2{}. Then you can add any selectors to all of the h2 on the page.
    19. What is the difference between a class and an id? - Give me an example of when I might use each one: The difference between a class and an id is that an id can only be used for one element per page, whereas a class can be used for multiple elementes on a page. For example, an id would be equivalent to a drivers license (each person has their own unique license number). A class is similar to a classroom (which contains many students).
    20. How do we select classes in CSS? To select a class use a period before the class name. Ex: class= "class1" would be selected by typing .class1{}. 
    21. How do we select a p element with a single class of “human””? Type the following: p .human{ }. 
    22. What is a parent child selector? When would this be useful? 
    23. How do you select all links within a div with the class of sidebar?

    26. What do we use to change the spacing between letters?
    27. What do we use to to change everything to CAPITALS? lowercase? Capitalize?
    28. How do I add a 1px border around my div that is dotted and black?
    29. How do I select everything on the page? 
    30. How do I write a comment in CSS?
    31. How do I find out what file I am in, when I am using the command line? 
    32. Using the command line - how do I see a list of files/folders in my current folder?
